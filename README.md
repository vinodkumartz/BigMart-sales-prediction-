## Overview
BigMart, a major retail chain, aims to leverage its data to forecast future sales for improved planning and inventory management. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict sales, providing actionable insights to enhance business operations.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Size:** 8,523 rows and 12 columns  
- **Target Variable:** `Item_Outlet_Sales` (Sales amount for each product)  
- **Key Features:**  
  - `Item_Identifier`: Unique product ID  
  - `Outlet_Identifier`: Store ID  
  - `Item_Weight`, `Item_Visibility`, `Item_Type`: Product-related attributes  
  - `Outlet_Size`, `Outlet_Location_Type`, `Outlet_Type`: Store-related attributes  

---

## Project Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values (e.g., imputed `Item_Weight` values).  
   - Transformed categorical features using label encoding and one-hot encoding.  
   - Scaled numerical features to normalize values.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed sales trends based on product type, store type, and store location.  
   - Visualized relationships between product visibility, weight, and sales using scatter plots and heatmaps.  

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created new features (e.g., `Item_Fat_Content` grouped into fewer categories).  
   - Derived interaction variables such as product visibility per outlet type.  

---

## Models Used
- **Linear Regression:** Baseline model for sales prediction  
- **Random Forest Regressor:** Handled non-linearity and interactions well  
- **XGBoost:** Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Tried for comparison, though less effective  

---

## Results
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **RÂ² Score:** 93.75% (on training data)  
- **Test Accuracy:** 55.26%  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Lowest with the Random Forest model  

The **Random Forest** model performed best, balancing complexity and accuracy, and generalizing well to unseen data.
